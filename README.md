# Spirited

This is my config for nix os, written for 3 devices :  
kamaji : main laptop  
boiler : "powerful" server  
bathhouse : 24/7 small server  

# Usage

copy (and modify if needed) the etc-configuration.nix to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

then use the rebuild script to rebuild the nixos, and if successful it will commit,
with the number of the generation.
